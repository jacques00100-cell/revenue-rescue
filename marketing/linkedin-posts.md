## Post 1: Problem/Solution Angle

**HOOK:**
80% of callers hang up when they reach voicemail.

For a $5,000 HVAC job, that's $4,000 left on the table—every single time.

**PROBLEM:**
Service businesses live and die by the phone. But after 5 PM? Weekends? Holidays? Your best leads are going straight to voicemail and calling your competitor.

The math is brutal:
• 1 missed call/week = $20K+ lost revenue/year
• Most customers won't leave a message
• They'll call the next number on Google

**SOLUTION:**
Meet Revenue Rescue—an AI phone receptionist that answers every call, 24/7.

It sounds human. It books appointments. It qualifies leads. It never sleeps, never calls in sick, and never puts someone on hold.

**PROOF:**
Want to hear it in action? Call (817) 873-6706 right now. Seriously—try it. Ask about pricing, availability, or book a fake appointment.

**CTA:**
We're beta testing with 3 service businesses at $99/mo (normally $199). If you own an HVAC, plumbing, or home services company and you're tired of missed calls stealing your revenue—DM me "RESCUE" and I'll send you the details.

## Post 2: Founder Journey Angle

**HOOK:**
I work at JP Morgan by day.

By night, I'm building the AI receptionist I wish my dad had when he ran his HVAC business.

**STORY:**
Growing up, I watched my dad lose jobs—not because he wasn't the best technician in town, but because he couldn't answer the phone while he was knee-deep in a furnace repair.

Every missed call was a family dinner interrupted. Every voicemail was a race against competitors. Every "I'll call them back tomorrow" was revenue walking out the door.

Sound familiar?

**SOLUTION:**
That's why I built Revenue Rescue—an AI phone receptionist that never misses a call, never needs a break, and books appointments while you do the work only you can do.

It's not a chatbot. It's a voice agent that sounds human, understands context, and integrates with your calendar.

**PROOF:**
Don't believe an AI can handle your customers? Test it yourself: (817) 873-6706

Call it. Ask tough questions. Try to break it. I'll wait.

**CTA:**
Looking for 3 beta customers to prove this out. $99/mo for the first 3 businesses (then $199). If you run a service business and you're sick of voicemail stealing your leads—DM me "BETA" and let's talk.

## Post 3: Results-Driven Angle

**HOOK:**
Your competitors are asleep. Your AI receptionist isn't.

While they're sending leads to voicemail, you're booking appointments at 2 AM.

**PROBLEM:**
The service business graveyard is full of great technicians who couldn't answer the phone.

Here's what I learned talking to 50+ HVAC and home service owners:
• 60%+ of revenue calls come after hours
• Average response time to voicemail: 4+ hours
• By then, 70% of prospects already booked with someone else

**SOLUTION:**
Revenue Rescue fixes this with an AI receptionist that:
→ Answers every call instantly
→ Sounds indistinguishable from human
→ Qualifies leads and books appointments
→ Integrates with your existing calendar
→ Costs less than 2 days of a human receptionist

**PROOF:**
See for yourself. Call (817) 873-6706 now and experience what your customers would hear.

Try booking an appointment. Ask about services. Test it like a real customer would.

**CTA:**
Taking on 3 beta customers at $99/mo (retail: $199). This isn't theory—we're live and booking real appointments.

Own a service business? DM me "RESCUE" and I'll show you how to stop losing revenue to voicemail.
